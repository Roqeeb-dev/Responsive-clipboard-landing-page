## My process

I first structured it with HTML and then styled it with CSS. I divides each section into parts with the section tag for easy access and modularized code. I also used classes to ensure reusability and less bulky code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt a lot to be factual. But most importantly, i improved my skills drastically in flexbox formatting because as you can see, this project consists of a lot of flexboxes embedded within other flexboxes. I learnt about relative units too.

### Continued development

If you notice, I refrained from using grids. And this was intentional not only because i had a relatively easier alternative but also because i wasn't that comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- Youtube tutors
- Telegram channels
- My friend, Haleemah who also doubles as my accountability partner.
